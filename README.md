# ðŸ’° Warren

Warren is a stock market predictor that uses information from the S&P 500 index, machine learning provided by sklearn.metrics, and data from yfinance. I used this project as a way for me to learn how to use Jupyter aswell as introduce myself to machine learning. This project is largely based on [this video](https://youtu.be/1O_BenficgE?si=xwUR8OASjX8lsxPZ) by [Dataquest](https://www.youtube.com/@Dataquestio).
